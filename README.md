# Summary of Findings
-Traditional methods (token-based), particularly with cosine similarity, achieved the highest overall ROUGE scores.
This can be attributed to their focus on exact word overlap, which aligns with the ROUGE evaluation methodology.

-WordNet-based semantic similarity recorded the highest ROUGE-2 scores.
By incorporating synonym-level information, it captured semantically meaningful bigrams, enhancing bigram overlap evaluation.

-FastText-based methods consistently underperformed relative to other approaches.
Although these methods encode semantic relationships via embeddings, ROUGE does not reward semantic similarity unless lexical matches are present.
